# Deployment

There are multiple platforms to host a website, such as DigitalOcean, Heroku etc. 
For the purpose of this site to ease database upload, we have chosen to use the AWS Elastic Beanstalk. 

This will involve: 
1. Installation: setting up the Elastic Beanstalk command line interface (EB CLI) on Windows.
2. Setting the Django app on Windows.
3. Setting up the Elastic Beanstalk on Windows.
4. Deployment
